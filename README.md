# Accurate-Counting-BloomFilters
A Multilevel optimization approach, an Accurate Counting Bloom Filter which helps in decreasing the false positive rate and hence in decreasing redundant and unwanted data in big data.
Bloom filters are space-efficient randomized data structures that allow for false positives in query searches. On the given dynamic sets that can be updated through insertions and deletions, 
Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs) conduct the same actions. CBFs have been widely employed in memory to reduce the size of datasets for large-scale data processing on massive clusters.
For filtering out more redundant data, the false positive likelihood of the CBF should be generated low. This research suggests a multilevel optimization strategy for minimizing the false positive probability
of an Accurate Counting Bloom Filter (ACBF). We present an optimized ACBF that maximizes the first level size to reduce false positives while keeping the same functionality as CBF.
We discovered counting bloom filters' functioning, efficiency, and error rate in the previous project (mini-project). And we found that it performs better than the standard Bloom Filter.
